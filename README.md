# Hydraulic-model-calibration-data
The data from this repository is used for a water supply model calibration.


There are five groups measured data including pressure and flow rate.


The input layer of the ANN consisted of 29 neurons, representing the 22 pressure measuring nodes and 7 flow measuring nodes.

The output layer comprised of 61 neurons, corresponding to the 57 pressure monitoring nodes and 4 flow monitoring nodes.

The training and testing data can be seen in samples_input data and samples_output data.
